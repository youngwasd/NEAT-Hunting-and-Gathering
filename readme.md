## ðŸ§  About This Project

This project explores the co-evolution of prey and predator agents to study how their behaviors develop over successive generations. By designing evolutionary AI agents and simulating preyâ€“predator dynamics, we aim to observe the emergence of complex strategies and adaptive behaviors that arise naturally from their interactions.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Co-evolution**: Feel free to experiment by enabling this feature; be sure to have both prey and predator in the simulation at the same time.
- **Binocular Vision**: Freely customize the agent's vision settings (monocular and binocular vision) with options to change the number of vision rays and the distance between binocular eyes.
